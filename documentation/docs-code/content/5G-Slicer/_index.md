        <p class="lead">Experimentation with 
5G-enabled services over network slices is extremely challenging as it requires the 
deployment and coordination of numerous physical devices, including
edge and cloud resources.
To alleviate the difficulties in setting up real-world 5G testbeds, 
we introduce 5G-Slicer extension of the Fogify framework. 
5G-Slicer facilitates the definition of mobile network slices 
through modeling abstractions for radio units, mobile nodes, trajectories, etc., 
while also offering realistic network QoS by dynamically altering -at runtime- signal strength. 
Moreover, 5G-Slicer provides an already realized scenario for a city-scale deployment that 
smart-city researchers can simply configure through a "ready-to-use" template, 
leaving 5G-Slicer responsible for translating it into an emulated environment. </p>

## 5G-Slicer Overview
<p></p>

<div class="container-md">
<div class="row justify-content-center">
   <div class="row">
   <div class="col-lg-6" style="text-align: justify">
   
A typical deployment starts by either describing the application services and network fabric via the 5G-Slicer model 
specification or by parameterizing a "ready-to-use" testbed template. 
The model specification can denote a wide range of network slice parameters, including the position of compute nodes and RUs, 
network links and their QoS, mobile node traces, communication protocols and VNFs applicable on nodes. 
On the contrary, parametrizable use-case templates automatically produce 5G deployments for IoT applications. 
The output of each template is a programming view equivalent to a validated deployment description. 
The topology and trajectories are propagated to the control layer.

Then, the system extracts from the description the network slice specification
and any signal degradation models defined during the modeling process. 
With these, it produces an in-memory Network Conceptual Graph (NCG), which contains the aforementioned information 
and will be used by the system for the runtime state propagation during the experimentation. 
The graph nodes represent network and compute devices annotated with information about their capabilities and 
deployed services, while edges denote the links between the nodes.
The weight of each edge is determined by network QoS, incl. data rate, network delay, packet and error rate. 
Then 5G-Slicer translates the NCG to an emulated environment by utilizing the Fogify Emulator Connector.

<p></p>

</div>
The connector is responsible for the emulation environment instantiation, and the deployment of the IoT application  through the FogifySDK. 
Furthermore, the Trajectory Manager parses the traces and applies the updates on the NCG, 
and, in turn propagates these to the running emulated environment.
One can view through an interactive map the traces of mobile nodes, 
their performance (i.e. cpu, energy), and the load imposed to MECs.
